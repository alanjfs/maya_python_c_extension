[Cyrille Fauvel](http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/2012/06/expose-your-code-to-python-the-python-way.html), 
whose blog provided a trove of information on how to write this extension.

[Official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html) 
basically contains a majority of the information I go over in this tutorial 
(excluding the Maya-specific areas) and is an invaluable resource for this subject.
I would recommend perusing it if only for reference.

**Siew Yi Liang**: I wrote this overly-long wall of text and the example code
here. You can find more of my ramblings [here](http://www.sonictk.com/blog).
