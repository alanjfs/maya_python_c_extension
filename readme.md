This is an example of how to create a Python C++ extension for Maya. It also contains 
a full tutorial of how to write the code.


# Building

## Requirements

- Windows (Linux should work, but is not the focus of this tutorial)
- Maya 2018 and above, along with the devkit for the corresponding version.

## Instructions

Run ``build.bat`` on Windows or ``build.sh`` if you are on Linux. A new ``msbuild``/``linuxbuild``
